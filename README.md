# Notes.sh

This is a personal project that I have started in order to help me maintain a good workflow with my notes.
The idea is that I can run this script and it will compile my separate notes into pdfs for each module.
This was inspired by Conner McDaniel's [notes script](https://github.com/connermcd/notes).

## TODO as of September 2018
- [ ] Add functionality to choose what year and module to compile
- [ ] Add a usage function to show examples to the user
- [ ] Improve the documentation on github
- [ ] Extract colors from echo calls to improve readability
